'''Encapsulation is the process of hiding the internal state of an object and requiring 
all interactions to be performed through an objectâ€™s methods. This approach:

Provides better control over data.
Prevents accidental modification of data.
Promotes modular programming.
Python achieves encapsulation through public, protected and private attributes.'''
